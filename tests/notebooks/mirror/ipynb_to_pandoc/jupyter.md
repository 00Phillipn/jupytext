::: {.cell .markdown}
Jupyter notebook
================

This notebook is a simple jupyter notebook. It only has markdown and
code cells. And it does not contain consecutive markdown cells. We start
with an addition:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="1"}
``` {.python}
a = 1
b = 2
a + b
```

::: {.output .execute_result execution_count="1"}
    3
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
Now we return a few tuples
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="2" scrolled="true"}
``` {.python}
a, b
```

::: {.output .execute_result execution_count="2"}
    (1, 2)
:::
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="3"}
``` {.python}
a, b, a+b
```

::: {.output .execute_result execution_count="3"}
    (1, 2, 3)
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
And this is already the end of the notebook
